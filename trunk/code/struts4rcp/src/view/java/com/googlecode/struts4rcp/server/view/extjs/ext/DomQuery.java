@Description("* Provides high performance selector/xpath processing by compiling queries into reusable functions. New pseudo classes and matchers can be plugged. It works on HTML and XML documents (if a content node is passed in)."
		+ "DomQuery supports most of the CSS3 selectors spec, along with some custom selectors and basic XPath."
		+ "All selectors, attribute filters and pseudos below can be combined infinitely in any order. For example 'div.foo:nth-child(odd)[@foo=bar].bar:first' would be a perfectly valid selector. Node filters are processed in the order in which they appear, which allows you to optimize your queries for your document structure. ")
